The goal of namespaces is to create an illusion that resources seen by a process are the only resources the system has.

Basically, namespaces are an isolation technology for processes which are sharing the same kernel.

Namespaces are one of the basic building blocks of containers.

UTS stands for Unix Time Sharing, and it's a namespace.
