A good way to get into the world of Distributed Tracing is to begin with Jaeger.

Distributed Tracing is a method of tracking (monitor) application requests built on microservices architecture. It helps developers to find performance issues in their applications. You can think of it as "monitoring for microservices".

What is Jaeger? Jaeger inspired by Dapper and OpenZipkin, is a distributed tracing platform created by Uber Technologies and can be used for monitoring microservices based distributed systems.
