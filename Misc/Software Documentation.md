Software documentation provides information about the product to software engineers, business analysts (if any), project managers, and business users. There are many types of documentation, and here are *some* documents we recommend to have within a product team *at minimum*:
- System (design) architecture
- User-access matrix (UAM)
- API Documentation
- Test plan
- List of unresolved security vulnerabilities (aka Vulnerability Risk Register)

For API Documentation, the following should be provided: an example of every call, every parameter, and responses (including error codes and messages) for each call.

These documents should be revisited and kept up-to-date once every 3 to 4 months.
