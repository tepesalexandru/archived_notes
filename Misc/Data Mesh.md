A Data Mesh approach could improve the Data Lake/house as the dominant architectual paradigm. It is important to understand that the Data Mesh concept primarily establishes a new organizational perspective and is less based on technical problem solving. Therefore, you should considder these four principles when building up a Data Mesh organization:
1. Domain-Oriented decentralized data ownership and architecture
2. Data as a product
3. Self-serve data infrastructure as a platform
4. Federated computational governance
