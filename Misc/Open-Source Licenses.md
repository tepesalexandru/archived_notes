title: "Open-Source Licenses"
---
Every open-source project has a license attached to it.
Projects that are not open-source are called closed-source.

There are multiple categories of licenses in the open-source world, such as:

Attribution: BSD, MIT, Apache
Downstream: MPL, EPL, MS-RL
Copyleft: GPL, LGPL, AGPL

The first category is the most permissive, while the last one is the most restrictive.
