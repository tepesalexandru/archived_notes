PolyBase is a `data virtualization` tool feature for SQL Server.

PolyBase enables your SQL Server instance to query data with T-SQL directly from SQL Server, Oracle, Teradata, MongoDB, Hadoop clusters, Cosmos DB, and S3-compatible object storage without separately installing client connection software.

PolyBase allows T-SQL queries to join the data from external sources to relational tables in an instance of SQL Server.
