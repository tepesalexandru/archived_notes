`Terragrunt` is an additional wrapper that is built on top of Terraform. Terraform is a great Infrastructure as Code tool for managing your cloud infrastructure. But as the project size grows and you have multiple environments (Development, Testing, Staging, Production, etc.) to manage then you will realize Terraform has a lot of gaps for managing a complex and large project.
