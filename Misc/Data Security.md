Data Masking is a data security measure that obfuscates sensitive data by replacing subsets of the data with characters or numbers. This essentially generated an entirely new piece of data that may contain elements of the original, however the chances of reverting it back to the original are low.

There are two main types of data masking:
- Dynamic Data Masking
- Static Data Masking
