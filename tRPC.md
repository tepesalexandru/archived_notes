`tRPC` allows us to write end-to-end typesafe APIs without any code generation or runtime bloat.

It uses Typescript's great inference to infer your API router's type definitions and lets you cann your API procedures from your frontend with full typesafety and autocompletion.

When using `tRPC`, your front and backend feel closer together than ever before, allowing for an outstanding developer experience.
