## Introduction
Azure Data Explorer is a fast, fully managed data analytics service for real-time analysis on large volumes of data streaming from applications, websites, IoT devices, and more.

You can discover hidden insights from streaming data. The intuitive query language makes it easy to find answers quickly in rapidly changing data.

## Service Capabilities
### Low-Latency Ingestion
Elastically scale to terabytes of data in minutes. This data management service offers fast, low-latency ingestion with linear scaling that supports up to 200 MB of data per second per node.

### Fast Read-Only Queries
Get results from 1 billion records in less than a second without modifying the data or metadata. You can query large amounts of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.

The intuitive query language uses Microsoft IntelliSense options and color coding to help you quickly spot patterns, trends, and anomalies.

### Time-Series Analysis
Create and analyze thousands of time series in seconds with near-real-time monitoring solutions and workflows. Azure Data Explorer includes native support for creation, manipulation, and analysis for multiple time series.

### Fully Managed Data Service
With Azure Data Explorer, you can focus on your data instead of the infrastructure. It has built-in automatic scaling in order to meeet your demands. It has no upfront costs or termination fees, and you only pay for what you need.

### Cost-Effective Queries and Storage
Ask unlimited questions without skyrocketing costs, since you pay by the hour, not by the query. You also control your storage costs.

## Use Cases
### IoT Applications
IoT devices generate billions of sensor readings. Normalizing and aggregating data typically requires multiple technologies, which slows analysis, complicates maintanence, and leads to reliability issues.

Azure Data Explorer facilitates remote monitoring of manufacturing equipment, vehicles, and systems that continously cycle through operations.

### Big Data Logging Platform
Publishers, ad networks, gaming sistes, and other web-based businesses rely on large volumes of log data to spot trends, patterns, or anomalies in near-real time.

With data exploration, discover insights that help you gain new customers, increase user engagement, and monetize traffic. Use this instant analysis of billions of lines of log data to generate personalized recommendations to visitors, predict which results and content suggestions they're most likely to click on, and learn which content will lead to new subscriptions and purchases.

### SaaS applications
Embed Azure Data Explorer in SaaS applications to ingest and analyze petabytes of data in real-time. Developers are using this data to monitor service and improve application performance, while business users are discovering user trends, creating personalized experiences, and developing new revenue streams.

## Query Engine
Kusto EngineV3 is Azure Data Explorer's performance update next generation storage and query engine. It's designed to provide unparallel performance for ingesting and querying telemetry, logs, and timeseries data.

A Kusto query is a read-only request to process data and return results. The request is stated in plain text, using a data-flow model that is easy to read, author, and automate. Kusto queries are made of one or more query statements.

There are three kinds of user query statements:
- A tabular expression statement
- A let statement
- A set statement
