The time elapsed since an work item is created until it's completed is called `Lead Time`. On the other hand, the time since an work item is active until it's completed is called `Cycle Time`.

A short notation would be the following:

- Creation -> Completed = `Lead Time`
- Active -> Completed = `Cycle Time`
