title: "Infrastructure as Code"
---

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a process of managing computer infrastructure in files. There are two components to IaC. The first is provisioning resources through deployment. The second is managing the deployed resources as code. In both cases, describing infrastructure as code is the necessary precondition.

The most popular IaC tool is Terraform which uses Go as the scripting language. Ansible by RedHat uses Python and is another popular tool.

On the other hand, cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP have their own IaC tools.
- AWS has CloudFormation (YAML)
- Azure has Azure Resource Manager (JSON)
- Google has Cloud Deployment Manager (Python)
