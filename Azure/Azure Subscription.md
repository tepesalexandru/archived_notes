## Regions
A `region` is a geographical area on the planet containing at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters. The datacenters are in close proximity and networked together with low-latency network.

Examples of regions are West US, Canada Central, West Europe, Australia East, and Japan West.

## Subscriptions
An Azure subcription is a logical unit of Azure services that's linked to an Azure account. Subscriptions help you organize access to Azure cloud services, and help you control how resource usage is reported, billed, and paid.

There are many ways of obtaining an Azure subscription, these being:
- Personal free account
- Microsoft partner
- Microsoft reseller
- `Enterprise agreement` - this provides flexibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement. The agreement comes with discounts for new licenses and software assurance.

## Resource tagging
You can apply tags to your Azure resources to logically organize them by categories. Tags are useful for sorting, searching, managing, and doing analysis on your resources.

Each resource tag consists of a name and a value. You could have the tag name `server` and the value `production` or `development`, and then apply the tag/value pair to your Engineering computer resources.
