Azure provides a variety of powerful chatbot-related services:
- creating rule-based chatbots
- understanding user intents
- creating simple FAQ chatbots
- orchestrating all those services

Azure Bot Service is probably the most important Azure chatbot service. It allows the integration of all the other services and defines how the chatbot should work. In fact, the development of Azure chatbots always starts from this service.

There are two ways to build a chatbot using Azure Bot Service:
1. Using Bot Framework Composer
2. Using Bot Framework SDK
