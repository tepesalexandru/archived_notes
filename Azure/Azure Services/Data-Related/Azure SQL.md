Azure supports multiple database services, such as `SQL Server`, `PostgreSQL`, and `MySQL`, in the cloud.

`Azure SQL` is a collective term for a family of Microsoft SQL Server based database services in Azure. Some of these services are the following:
- SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (`IaaS`)
- Azure SQL Managed Instance (`PaaS`)
- Azure SQL Database (`PaaS`)
- Azure SQL Edge - Optimal of `IoT` scenarios that need to work with `streaming` time-series data.

If you plan to migrate a `LAMP` stack to the cloud, you should use `Azure Database for MySQL`.
