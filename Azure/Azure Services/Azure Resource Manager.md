When using Azure Resource Manager, there are some terms you need to be familiar with:
- resource
- resource group
- resource provider
- template
- declarative syntax

Azure Resource Manager also offers locks on resource groups, and they can be of two types:
- Read-Only loks: prevent any changes to the resource
- Delete-locks: prevent deletion of the resource

You can also move resource between resource groups and subscription, as well as regions.

Resource groups cannot be nested.
