title: "Service Mesh"
---

A `service mesh` implements the communication layer for [[Microservices]] architecture. It ensures the delivery of service requests, provides load balancing, encrypts data (with TLS), and provides the discovery of other services.

A service mesh also:
- Provides circuit breaker logic
- Provides the process to manage traffic control, network resilience, security, and authentication
- Has a proxy that integrates with microservices using a [[Sidecar Pattern]].
