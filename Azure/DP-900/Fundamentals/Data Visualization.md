`Dimension` tables represent the entities by which you want to aggregate numeric values - for example product or customer.

The numeric measures that will be aggregated by the various dimensions in the model are stored in `Fact` tables - for example the sales table.

After you've created a model, you can use it to generate data visualizations that can be implemented in a report. Power BI includes an extensive set of built-in visualizations, some of them being:
- Tables and text
- Bar and column charts
- Line charts
- Pie charts
- Scatter plots
- Maps
