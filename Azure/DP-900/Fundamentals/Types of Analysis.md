# Types of Analysis
There are four main types of analysis:
- Descriptive
- Diagnostic
- Predictive
- Prescriptive

## Descriptive
The `descriptive` analysis answers the question: "what's happening?".

Examples:
- A visualization that shows a university's current student enrollment versus the maximum capacity.
- A visualization that illustrates a university's current student enrollment per department.

## Diagnostic
The `diagnostic` analysis answers the question: "why's happening?".

Examples
- Why did the sales increase last month?

## Predictive
The `predictive` analysis answers the question: "what will happen?".

Examples:

The forecast for the fourth quarter is an example of predictive analysis.

## Prescriptive
The `prescriptive` analysis answers the question: "what actions should we take?".

Examples 
- How do I allocate my budget to buy different inventory items?
- Provide specific guidance on how to allocate the current budget to buy different inventory items

## Cognitive Analysis
`Cognitive` analysis helps in cases in which services such as computer vision are required to perform an action.

Examples:
- Which people are mentioned in a company's business documents?
- Creating closed caption text for audio files
- Detect images of the company's logo included in PDF documents
