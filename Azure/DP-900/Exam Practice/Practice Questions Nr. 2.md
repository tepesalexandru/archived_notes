Q1. Objects in which things about data should be captured and stored are called `entities.` ✅

Q2. You need to process data that is generated continously and near real-time responses are required. You should use `streaming data processing`. ✅

Q3. ✅
- Optimize Privacy => ETL
- Provide support for Azure Data Lake => ELT
- Manage large volumes of data ELT

Q4. The technique that provides recommended actions that you should take to achieve a goal or target is called `prescriptive` analysis. ✅

Q5. ✅
- Create relationships => Keys
- Improve processing speed for data searches => Indexes
- Store instances of entities as rows => Tables
- Display data from predefined queries => Views 

Q6. The process of splitting an entity into more than one table to reduce data reducancy is called `normalization` ✅

Q7. Azure SQL Database is an example of a `platform`-as-a-service. ✅

Q8. ✅
- Query data while working within a Visual Studio Project => `SQL Server Data Tools`
- Query data located in a non-Microsoft platform => `Azure Data Studio`
- Query data from within the Azure portal => `Azure Query Editor`

Q9. The act of increasing or decreasing the resources that are available for a service is called `scaling`. ✅

Q10. ✅
- Filter records => WHERE
- Combine rows from multiple tables => JOIN
- Calculate the total value of a numeric column => SUM
- Determine the number of rows retrieved => COUNT

Q11. What are three characteristics of non-relational data? ✅
- Flexible storage of ingested data
- Entities are self-describing
- Entities may have different fields

Q12. You have data that consists of JSON-bases documents. You need to store the data in an Azure environment that supports efficient non-key, field-based searching. You should use `Azure Cosmos DB` as the data store. ✅

Q13. You need to create a graph database => `Azure Cosmos DB` ✅

Q14. You use Azure Table Storage as a non-relational data store.
You need to optimize data retrieval. You should use `partition keys and row keys` as query criteria. ✅

Q15. You need to use JSON files to provision Azure Storage => `ARM templates`. ✅

Q16. For which reason should you deploy to a data warehouse? => Perform sales trend analysis ✅

Q17. Which two Azure data services support Apache Spark clusters? ✅
- Azure Synapse Analytics
- Azure Databricks

Q18. You design a data ingestion and transofmration solution by using Azure Data Factory service. You need to get data from an Azure SQL Database. Which two resources should you use? ✅
- Linked services
- Dataset

Q19. Which Azure Data Factory component should you use to represent data that you want to ingest for processing? => `Datasets` ✅

Q20. For which three scenarios can you create Power BI reports as paginated reports?
- a report that has a table visual with an ability to print all the data in the table
- a report whit a repeatable header and footer
- a report that is formatted to fit well on a printed page ✅

Result => 20/20 (100%) ✅
