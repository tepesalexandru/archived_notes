102. DRAG DROP
- Enables the use of SQL queries against data stored in JSON documents => `Comos DB`
- Enables users to access data by using the Server Message Block (SMB) version 3 protocol => `Azure Files`
103. When provisioning an Azure Comos DB `account`, you need to specify which type of API you will use.
104. You need to store data by using Azure Table Storage. What should you create first? `A storage account`
105. You need to recommend a data store service that meets the following requirements:
- Native SQL API access
- Configurable indexes
What should you recommend? `Azure Cosmos DB`
106. HOT SPOT
- Azure Table storage within a single Azure Storage account supports multiple concurrent reads in different Azure regions => `yes`
- Azure Table storage within a single Azure Storage account supports multiple concurrent writes in different Azure regions => `no`
- An Azure Cosmos DB account that uses the Table API supports multiple concurrent reads in different Azure regions. => `yes`
- An Azure Cosmos DB account that uses the Table API supports multiple concurrent writes in different Azure regions. => `yes`
107. To configure an Azure Storage account to support access control lists that have object-level permissions, `enable the hierarchical namespace`.
108. Your company needs to design a database that illustrates the relationships between utilization levels of individual network devices across a local area network. Which type of data store should you use? `graph`
109. You manage an application that stores data in a shared folder on a Windows server. You need to move the shared folder to Azure Storage. Which type of Azure Storage should you use? `file`
110. Your company is designing a database that will contain session data for a website. The data will include notifications, personalization attributes, and products that are added to a shopping cart. Which type of data store will provide the lowest latency to retrieve the data? `columnar`
111. You have an application that runs on Windows and requires access to a mapped drive. Which Azure service should you use? `Azure Files`
112. HOT SPOT

- You can use blob, table, and file storage in the same Azure Storage account. => `yes`
- You implement Azure Data Lake Storage by creating an Azure Storage account => `yes`
117. When using the Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API, the container resource type is projected as a `graph`.
118. At which two levels can you set the throughput for an Azure Cosmos DB account?

- The Azure Cosmos DB Table API supports multiple read replicas => `yes`
- The Azure Cosmos DB Table API supports multiple write regions => `yes`
120. `PolyBase` is an Azure Synapse Analytics feature that retrieves data from Azure Blob storage by using Transact-SQL queries.
