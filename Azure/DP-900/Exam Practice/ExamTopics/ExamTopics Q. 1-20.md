8. You are reviewing the data model shown in the following exhibit 📝
![](https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04162/0001200001.png)

The data model is a `star schema`.
Customer is a `dimension` table.

Explaination: In computing, the star schema is the simplest style of data mart schema and is the approach most widely used to develop data warehouses and dimensional data marts. The star schema consists of one or more fact tables referencing any number of dimension tables. The star schema is an important special case of the snowflake schema, and is more effective for handling simpler queries.
