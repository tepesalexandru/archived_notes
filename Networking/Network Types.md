All networks are built on the same principles. You can apply these principles to design and build your organization's local network or cloud-based networks.

When you build a network, you need to know about the different types of networks, their topologies, and their uses.

### What is a Network?
A network is a collection of network-enabled devices, typically made up of computers, switches, routers, printers, and servers.

Networks are a fundamental part of day-to-day life, and exists in homes, workplaces, and public areas. Networks allow all types of network-enabled devices to communicate.

### Network Types
Networks are categorized in one of the following four categories:
1. Personal Area Networks (**PAN**)
2. Local Area Networks (**LAN**)
3. Metropolitan Area Networks (**MAN**)
4. Wide Area Networks (**WAN**)


### Personal Area Networks
A PAN provides networking needs around an individual. An example of a PAN is where a smartphone, smarwatch, tablet, and laptop are all connected and share data without the need to connect to an access point or other third-party network services.

PAN networks typically use Bluetooth to communicate because it provided a low-power, short-range data-sharing capability.

The network standards associated with PAN are Bluetooth and IEEE 802.15.

### Local Area Networks
A LAN provides networking needs around a single location. This location might be an organization's office, a school, a university, a hospital, an airport, and many others.

A LAN is usually privately owned and needs authentication and authorization to access.

Out of all network types, LAN is by far the most commonly used.

### Metropolitan Area Networks
A MAP provides network capabilities between two different locations within a city or metropolitan area to provide a single extensive network.

Typically, a MAN requires a dedicated and secure connection between each LAN joined to the MAN. The man in the middle is usually an Internet Service Provider (**ISP**).

### Wide Area Networks
A WAN provides network capabilities between two different geographical locations locally or worldwide.

For example, a WAN is used to connect an organization's head office with branch offices all over the region.

A WAN links multiple LANs together to create one super network. With a WAN, you use a Virtual Private Network (**VPN**) to manage the connection between different LANs.
