## Neural Networks
Artificial Neural Networks (`ANNs`) are one approach to create AI - programs that imitate the cognitive functions of humans. AANs were invited in order to understand and emulate the functions of the mammalian brain.

Just as biological neurons are the basic unit of the brain, `artificial neurons` are the computation building block of an artificial neuronal network.

Just like biological neurons, artificial neurons respond to the information that's presented to them.

Neurons can be used as input to other neurons, creating `Layered Networks`.

ANN can `learn`, but they are simply mathematical models. They cannot `think`.
