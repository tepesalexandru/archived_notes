The `/proc` directory is a `virtual filesystem` that provides information about the system's processes and kernel. It's called a virtual filesystem because it lives inside of the RAM, and consumes no physical storage. If the system is rebooted, the RAM is cleared and all that inside the `/proc` directory will be lost.

It provides information about specific aspects of th system. For example, the `/proc/cpuinfo` file provides information about the system's CPU (such as the number of cores, clock speed, and cache size), and the `/proc/meminfo` file provides information about the system's memory usage. The contents of these files can be seen with the `cat` command.

The `/proc/sys` directory contains a number of files and subdirectories that can be used to modify kernel parameters, such as network settings and the maximum number of open files.

In order to change the maximum number of open files, you can modify the file `/proc/sys/fs/file-max`.

In order to view the current maximum value, you can use the following command:

```bash
sysctl fs.file-max
```
In order to change this value, you can use the following command:

```bash
sysctl -w fs.file-max=[NEW_VALUE] # Replace [NEW_VALUE]
sysctl -w fs.file-max=1000 # For example, max 1000 open files
```


The `/proc/mounts` lists all mounted file systems, similar to the `mount` command.
